# Productivity_App 

***Aim*** : The ultimate aim of this project is to understand the basics of Flutter and learning how to build an Rest API using Flask.

Last but not the least advantage we'll have from contributing to this project is grasping the knowledge of how version control works. On working with teams on GitHub we'll be able to learn the  working behind crucial version control commands.

Our goal is to build this productivity app for mobile devices be it android or iOS devices. Our app will have this beautiful UI. The frontend of this app is going to be built on Flutter which uses the Dart language to build native apps on iOS and Android platform from a single codebase.

### Backend

We'll be creating a database  to store all information. Furthermore we'll head on to building a Rest API in Python using Flask and finally we'll be hosting our API.
